# Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (GT-N7102)

This repository contains my attempt to port CyanogenMod to the Chinese version of Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (GT-N7102) which has an active dual-SIM capability (when you can call one SIM from another on the same device).

So far I managed to complete a successful build, but I'm struggling with the kernel.  This repository is not ready to be cloned and used since I don't have a working concept yet.
